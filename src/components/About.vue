<h2>About me</h2>
<hr/>
<p>Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a full stack software developer. I am familiar with many programming languages frameworks and tools for example: Vue (which I built this site with), React, Svelte, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++/C, Unrealscript, C#, Python, Java, Xamarin.Forms, .NET MAUI, Unity, Unreal Engine 3, Unreal Engine 5 and Node.js. I also am very familiar with Apache, NGINX and Linux. I actually use Arch linux as my desktop's operating system, but I've used many other distros like Gentoo and Ubuntu, this server is actually running on an Ubuntu server right now.</p>

<p>I am currenting working as a software developer at <a href="https://chromatic.games/">Chromatic Games</a>.
At Chromatic Games I've worked on many different things within the company, such as Dungeon Defenders 2, our backends for our games, an internal dashboard for one of the backends, and an unreleased Unreal Engine 5 project.
I also do some freelance work on the side, most of the freelance work is full stack development for mobile apps on Andoird and iOS.
The apps I am working on at the moment are Montjoy and Linguicity. Montjoy is currently available on the app stores in the US. I also play many intruments such as guitar, bass, drums, piano, cello, etc. I play in a band as the lead guitarist. For more information about the projects I've worked on check out the projects page.</p>
